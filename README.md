# marriottcalc
A web application for converting total spend at a Marriott hotel into the equivalent Marriott Reward points. Marriott Hotel’s do not currently offer such a calculator on their website, so thought this could be a fun little project.

All JavaScript and CSS is inline. JS library dependancies and images are served from external URL’s. 

Uses the money.js JavaScript currency conversion library to convert a users expenditure from GBP to USD based on current exchange rates, and then applies a simple a function to output the equivalent reward points.

Reward points are rewarded using the following rules:

* Each USD ($) of expenditure translates to 10 Marriott Reward points

If you are a:

* Silver member, you are rewarded an additional 10% bonus points on top of this.
* Gold member, you are rewarded an additional 25% bonus points on top of this.
* Platinum member, you are rewarded an additional 50% bonus points on top of this.
